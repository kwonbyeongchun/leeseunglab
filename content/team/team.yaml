# Principal Investigator
- id: "cesar-terrer"
  name: "César Terrer"
  position: "ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT MIT CEE"
  bio: "He obtained his PhD in Ecosystem Ecology and Climate Change from Imperial College London, where he started working at the interface between experiments and models to better understand the effects of elevated CO2 on vegetation. Dr. Terrer's research has advanced our understanding on the effects of CO2 in terrestrial ecosystems, the role of soil nutrients in a climate change context, and plant-soil interactions."
