    title: 'Terrestrial Carbon Ecology',
    description: 'We advance knowledge about the ecological dynamics impacting terrestrial carbon storage in a climate change context (e.g., elevated CO₂, warming, fire, extreme weather, nitrogen deposition). The primary goals are to unravel the mechanisms of the terrestrial carbon sink, and to reduce key uncertainties about the sink in climate models.',

    description: 'We develop data-driven estimates of the mitigation potential of natural climate solutions. By synthesizing data collected by satellites and from published field studies, we seek to reduce spatial and temporal uncertainties about the effectiveness of soil- and forest-based pathways.',
